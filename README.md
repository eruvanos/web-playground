Temporary repo for PoC Arcade and pyglet web support


This repo provides experimental wheels until the changes are provided upstream.

To make use of them you can just start with a pyscript project:

- [Pyglet PoC](https://pyscript.com/@eruvanos/pyglet-web/)
- [Arcade PoC (wip)](https://pyscript.com/@eruvanos/arcade-web/)
